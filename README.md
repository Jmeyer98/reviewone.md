## Summary
The game follows the adventure of a chosen hero in the land of Ditto. This hero is called The Sword of Ditto, a title that has been passed down for hundreds of years as the need for a new hero arises. That need for a hero arises as Mormo, an evil sorceress, gains power to take over Ditto. The game starts with the hero being woken up on the beach by a god-like dung beetle named Puku. This starts the tutorial of the game. The tutorial leads the player to acquire the sword of ditto thus awakening them to the power of past heroes. The player is then lead to their death, thus introducing the cycle of death and rebirth. The tutorial continues into the start of the next hero's awakening before finally letting the player have free control.

The hero is tasked with taking down Mormo before she gains too much power, thus setting a time limit for the hero to level up and gain the power needed. One way of gaining more power is to build up an arsenal of weapons called toys. These toys can be bought in shops or found in special dungeons called Toy Dungeons. Each toy has its own abilities and can be upgraded to add more effects such as fire or poison. The use of these toys does have a cooldown in the form of a TP bar. Each toy drains this bar by varying amount, and once it runs out you will have to wait for it to refill. Along with toys, the player will also need to collect stickers. These stickers give the player passive boons that can be applied to their armor and sword slots. These stickers can be found in dungeon chests, dropped from monsters, or just bought from shops. A special collectable found only in dungeon chests are hero badges. These badges allow the player to choose a character they want to start as in their next playthrough. These characters have starting bonuses and their own unique toy and sticker at the start of the next playthrough.

The player will collect multiple types of currency varying on the area of the world they are in. Two of the main types of currency are the standard gold coins and a unique currency called celestial shards. The player unlocks this second currency after they visit their first whale fountain. These fountains are a shrine to the god entity Serendipity. If the player collects enough of these shards, they can trade them for a special item called Celestial Essence which will be used to revive the player if they were to die. This shard currency also allows the player to "purchase" the stickers, toys, and items they would like to cross over to the next playthrough.

One of the games unique aspects is its world generator. Each playthrough of the game is generated different from the last so each worlds layout is unique. The same applies to the toy and trial dungeons found in the world. This allows for a unique play experience each time.

## Final Thoughts

I put a total of 4 hours into my first playthough, which shows that each playthrough of the game isn't that long, but still enjoyable. The art style of the game was also pleasing and simple. It isn't overly elaborate, yet I still enjoyed finding new places to explore. The game does start off a little slow, mainly because the character runs so slow. Once I got the sword, I found myself rolling everywhere because it was faster way to travel across a big play area. Now, because of the unique world generator, there is no real walkthrough you can look up if you get stuck. This brings me to the second toy dungeon in my playthrough. I encountered a puzzle that couldn't be solved in the room before the boss. I ran around the dungeon for almost an hour revisiting rooms thinking I missed something, but no, the generation of the room was bugged so the puzzle couldn't be solved. This also meant that the toy trial dungeon was impassable as well. This was bad because one of Mormo's power anchors was in that dungeon which meant I couldn't weaken her any further. This almost had me quit the game. 

Despite the bad experience of my first playthrough, there are aspects of the game that I really enjoyed. One of the aspects I really enjoyed about the game was the sticker boons. I got a sticker that made my character impervious to bombs and found myself charging into every self-destructing enemy. The next is the toy powerups. You can increase the power of a single toy multiple times and for free! There is no cost in upgrading toys. All you need is the upgrade material and a quick visit to the toy shop. Another thing that the game did right was its fast travel system. This allowed you to travel across the map if you activated the travel location in that area. Finally, the saving grace that I forgot about is the Celestial Essence. I almost didn't beat my first playthrough (because of the bugged dungeon) since I hadn't taken down both anchors. Mormo's overly strong guardian killed me on the third floor, but thanks to that essence I lived to fight another day. 

While there are parts of the game what could have been done better, I had a blast playing it. The art style was pleasing to look at and the music was a joy to listen to while rolling across the world. My overall experience of the game wasn't bad and in fact had me captivated. I could stop playing! As soon as I finished my first playthrough it thrusted me into the next hero's era and had to stop myself from playing that one to completion as well.
